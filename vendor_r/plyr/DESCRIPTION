Title: Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data
Version: 1.8.8

Description: A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need
    to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each
    piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
    might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time point in
    your study, summarise data by panels or collapse high-dimensional
    arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development of 'plyr' has
    been generously supported by 'Becton Dickinson'.
