2019.6

- Register native routines (thanks to Don Tawanpitak).

2017.2

- Fix the GPA variable in the "law" dataset. The values are now of the form
  3.39, instead of 339. This is consistent with the book and with the "law82"
  dataset (thanks to Hon Hwang).
- Update maintainer email address.

2015.2

- Use stats::quantile with type = 1, instead of a manually coded
  quantile operation that resulted in a bug that lead to a zero
  index being used if small nboot, and alpha close to boundary
  (thanks to David Flater of NIST).
- Give warning if nboot not larger than 1/min(alpha, 1 - alpha)
  (thanks to David Flater of NIST).
- Give error if alpha values are not in (0,1).
