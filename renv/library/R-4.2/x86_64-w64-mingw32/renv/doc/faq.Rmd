## Why isn't my package being snapshotted into the lockfile?

By default, `renv` uses the intersection of:

1. Packages installed into your project library, and

2. Packages which appear to be used in your project, as discovered by
   `renv::dependencies()`,

in determining which packages should enter the lockfile. The intention is that
only the packages you truly require for your project should enter the lockfile;
development dependencies (e.g. `devtools`) normally should not.

If you find a package is not entering the lockfile, you can check the output of:

```
renv::dependencies()
```

and see whether usages of your package are reported in the output.

Note that `renv`'s dependency discovery machinery relies on static analysis of
your R code, and does not understand all of the different ways in which a
package might be used in a project. For example, `renv` will detect the
following usages:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

But it will be unable to detect these kinds of usages:

```r
for (package in c("dplyr", "ggplot2")) {
  library(package, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

If you use a custom package loader in your project that `renv` could feasibly
support, please feel free to [file a feature request](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues).


### Capturing all dependencies

If you'd instead prefer to capture _all_ packages installed into your project
library (and eschew dependency discovery altogether), you can do so with:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("all")
```

Packages can also be explicitly ignored through a project setting, e.g. with:

```
renv::settings$ignored.packages("<package>")
```

You might also want to double-check the set of ignored packages
(`renv::settings$ignored.packages()`) and confirm that you aren't
unintentionally ignoring a package you actually require.

See the documentation in `?snapshot` for more details.


### Capturing explicit dependencies

If you'd like to explicitly declare which packages your project depends on,
you can do so by telling `renv` to form "explicit" snapshots:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("explicit")
```

In this mode, `renv` will only include packages which are explicitly listed
in the project's `DESCRIPTION` file as dependencies.


## How should I handle development dependencies?

This is related to the above question: by design, `renv.lock` normally only
captures build-time or deploy-time dependencies; it may not capture the packages
that you use in iterative workflows (e.g. `devtools`). However, you may want
some way of still ensuring these development dependencies get installed when
trying to restore a project library.

For cases like these, we recommend tracking these packages in a project
DESCRIPTION file; typically, within the `Suggests:` field. Then, you can
execute:

```
renv::install()
```

to request that `renv` install the packages as described in the DESCRIPTION
file. In addition, the `Remotes:` fields will be parsed and used, to ensure
packages are installed from their declared remote source as appropriate.


## I'm returning to an older renv project. What do I do?

Suppose you were using `renv` to manage an older project's dependencies. You
have an older lockfile, capturing the dependencies in use when you were last
working with that project. You now need to resume work on this project --
what do you do?

The answer depends on how exactly you want to use the project. Do you want
to treat it as a "time capsule", with dependencies frozen in time? Or are
the dependencies in this project fluid, and you are primarily using `renv`
just for isolation of project dependencies?

For time capsules, the solution is to use `renv::restore()` to re-install the
exact packages as declared in the project lockfile `renv.lock`. You may also
need to find and install the older version of R used previously with that
project, unless your intention is to upgrade R.

For projects with fluid dependencies, one solution is to use `renv::init()`
to re-initialize the project with a brand new project library. When
`renv::init()` is invoked, you may see a question such as:

```
> renv::init()
This project already has a lockfile. What would you like to do?

1: Restore the project from the lockfile.
2: Discard the lockfile and re-initialize the project.
3: Activate the project without snapshotting or installing any packages.
4: Abort project initialization.
```

You can select option (2) to instruct `renv` to re-initialize the project,
effectively discarding the old lockfile and initializing the project with a new
project library. You may also want to call `renv::upgrade()` to ensure all
packages in the new project library are updated to the latest-available
versions, as well.

If you prefer a more managed approach, you might also consider the following
approach:

1. Use `renv::restore()` to restore the project state as defined in the
   lockfile,

2. Install and update packages deliberately, e.g. via `renv::install()`,
   `install.packages()`, or other relevant tools,

3. Call `renv::snapshot()` after you've finished updating the requisite
   packages, to generate a new lockfile.


## Why aren't packages installed in the system library visible in my renv projects?

By default, `renv` generates a "sandboxed" version of the system library,
containing only the base set of packages normally bundled and distributed with
R. If you'd prefer that packages installed into the system library remain
visible to `renv` projects, you can set:

```
RENV_CONFIG_SANDBOX_ENABLED = FALSE
```

in an appropriate `.Renviron` file. See the entry for
`renv.config.sandbox.enabled` in `?renv::config` for more details.
